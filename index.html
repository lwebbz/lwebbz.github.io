      Welcome to my portfolio site, I've created this firstly to disprove the
      notion that infrastructure and backend developers can't do frontend (it's
      barely an inconvenience) and secondly to impart nuggets of wisdom in the
      form of blog posts (if I can ever be bothered to write them).
